Advent of Code Exercises

Parts 1-6 were done after release, with somewhat of a focus on going fast, but mostly driven by solving fun puzzles.

Parts 7-8 were started within 1 hour of the release, and were written with the intention of cracking top 100. They are dirty, inefficient, and may have what appear to be purposely misnamed variables.

Part 7 got me 253rd, and Part 8 154th. The challenge continues. Merry Christmas!
